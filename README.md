# Learning Git and GitHub

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific 
versions later. Git is an open-source version control system that enables you to store code, track revision history, 
merge code changes, and revert to earlier code version when needed. It is command line tool that it is installed 
in locally in the system to manage source code version.

GitHub is Git repository hosting service delivered in a cloud based platform. GitHub also serves as a social 
networking site where developers, store, share and track code files and collaborate on software projects.

Whe working with Git you typically get a Git repository in one of two ways:
1. You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or
2. You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.

Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged, and committed
* Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
* Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
* Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database. 

This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project: the working tree, the staging area, and the Git directory.

If you want to intentionally to not track a file you should add a ".gitignore" file. It specifies intentionally 
untracked files that Git should ignore. Like user specific files generated by the IDE or sensitive information, 
like passwords.

## Git Commands

## _Setup and Config_

```shell
git rm  <file name>
```

### mv
Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
```shell
git mv  <file name> <new file name>
```

## _Branching and Merging_

### branch
List branches
```shell
git branch 
```
Create branch
```shell
git branch <branch name>
```
Connect a local branch to a branch in a remote repository
```shell
git branch --set-upstream-to = <repository name> <branch name>
```
```shell
git branch -u <repository name> <branch name>
```
Delete branch
```shell
git branch --delete <branch name>
```

### switch
Switch branches
```shell
git switch <branch name>
```
Create and switch to new branch
```shell
git switch -c <branch name>
```

### merge
Join two or more development histories together
```shell
git merge <branch name>
```

### checkout
Switch branches or restore working tree files
```shell
git checkout <branch name>
```

### stash
Stash the changes in a dirty working directory away
```shell
git stash
```
Show changes has been stashed
```shell
git stash list
```
Apply specified changes to working directory
```shell
git stash apply <list index number>
```
Delete the last element in the stash list and brings it to the working directory
```shell
git stash pop
```

## _Sharing and Updating Projects_

### remote
Connect a local repository to a remote repository
```shell
git remote add <alias name> <repository URL>
```
Remove a reference to remote repository
```shell
git remote remove <name>
```
Rename a remote repository
```shell
git remote rename <name> <new name>
```
List all tracked remote repositories
```shell
git remote --verbose
```
```shell
git remote -v
```

### fetch
Synchronized objects and refs from remote repository to local
```shell
git fetch
```

### pull
Fetch from and merge with remote repository and local branch
```shell
git pull
```

### push
Update remote refs along with associated objects
```shell
git push --set-upstream-to <repository name> <branch name>
```
```shell
git push -u <repository name> <branch name>
```
Send files from local directory to cloud repository
```shell
git push <repository name> <branch name>
```
Move all local branches to remote
```shell
git push --all
```

## _Inspection and Comparison_

### show

```

## Git Workflow
These are the four fundamental elements that composed the Git workflow:
* Workspace (Working Directory)
* Staging (Index)
* Local Repository (Head)
* Remote Repository

## Git Feature Branch Workflow
![Git Feature Branch Workflow](src/main/webapp/images/feature-branch-git-workflow.png)
The Git Feature Branch workflow is useful when you have more than one developer working on the same codebase.

Imagine you have one developer who is working on a new feature. And another developer working on a second feature. Now, if both the developers work from the same branch and add commits to them, it would make the codebase a huge mess with plenty of conflicts.

To avoid this, the two developers can create two separate branches from the master branch and work on their features individually. When theyâ€™re done with their feature, they can then merge their respective branch to the master branch, and deploy without having to wait for the second feature to be completed.

The Pros of using this workflow is, the git feature branch workflow allows you to collaborate on code and minimize code conflicts.


### How to do it

* You create a new branch, that's usually a feature or a fix branch. 
* You make changes to that branch. 
* Then you merge that branch back to master, and then 
* you delete the old branch.
