# Learning Git and GitHub

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific 
versions later. Git is an open-source version control system that enables you to store code, track revision history, 
merge code changes, and revert to earlier code version when needed. It is command line tool that it is installed 
in locally in the system to manage source code version.

GitHub is Git repository hosting service delivered in a cloud based platform. GitHub also serves as a social 
networking site where developers, store, share and track code files and collaborate on software projects.

Whe working with Git you typically get a Git repository in one of two ways:
1. You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or
2. You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.

Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged, and committed
* Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
* Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
* Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database. 

This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project: the working tree, the staging area, and the Git directory.

If you want to intentionally to not track a file you should add a ".gitignore" file. It specifies intentionally 
untracked files that Git should ignore. Like user specific files generated by the IDE or sensitive information, 
like passwords.

## Git Commands

## _Setup and Config_

### git
Root command doing the content tracking

Prints the Git suite version that the git program came from
```shell
git --version
```

Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands
```shell
git --help
```

### config
Get and set repository or global options
```shell
git config --global
```
```shell
git config --global user.name "<Your Name>"
```
```shell
git config --global user.email "<Your Email>"
```
## _Getting and Creating Projects_

### init
Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one
```shell
git init
```

### clone

```shell
git clone
```

## _Basic Snapshotting_

### add
Add file contents to the index (Staging)
```shell
git add <File Name>
```
Add all files contents to the index
```shell
git add --all
```

git add .
```

### status
Show the working tree status
```shell
git status 
```

### commit
Record changes to the repository
```shell
git commit -m "A descriptive message"
```
Add current changes to the last commit
```shell
git commit --amend
```
```shell
git commit -amend --no-edit
```
```shell
git commit -amend -m "New commit message"
```

### log
Show commit logs
```shell
git log
```
Git log summarized
```shell
git log --oneline
```

### restore
Restore working tree files
```shell
git restore <File Name>
```
Restore current directory
```shell
git restore .
```
Restore file from staging area
```shell
git restore --staged <File Name>
```

### reset
Reset current HEAD to the specified state
```shell
git reset <Commit Hash>
```

### rm
Remove files from the working tree and from the index
```shell
git rm  <File Name>
```

### mv
Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
```shell
git mv  <File Name> <New File Name>
```

## _Branching and Merging_

### branch
List, create, or delete branches
```shell
git branch 
```

```shell
git branch <branch name>
```

```shell
git branch --delete <branch name>
```

### switch
Switch branches
```shell
git switch -c <branch name>
```

### merge
Join two or more development histories together
```shell
git merge <branch name>
```

### checkout
Switch branches or restore working tree files
```shell
git checkout <branch name>
```

### stash
Stash the changes in a dirty working directory away
```shell
git stash
```

## _Sharing and Updating Projects_

### remote
Manage set of tracked repositories
```shell
git remote
```

### fetch
Download objects and refs from another repository
```shell
git fetch
```

### pull
Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
```shell
git pull
```

### push
Update remote refs along with associated objects
```shell
git push <Repository Name> <Branch Name>
```

## _Inspection and Comparison_

### show
```shell
git show
```

### diff
```shell
git diff
```

### describe
```shell
git describe
```

## _Patching_

### rebase
Reapply commits on top of another base tip
```shell
git rebase --interactive <Commit Hash>
```

```shell
git rebase --interactive <Branch Name>
```

### apply
```shell
git apply
```

### cherry-pick

## Git Feature Branch Workflow
![Git Feature Branch Workflow](src/main/webapp/images/feature-branch-git-workflow.png)
The Git Feature Branch workflow is useful when you have more than one developer working on the same codebase.

Imagine you have one developer who is working on a new feature. And another developer working on a second feature. Now, if both the developers work from the same branch and add commits to them, it would make the codebase a huge mess with plenty of conflicts.

To avoid this, the two developers can create two separate branches from the master branch and work on their features individually. When theyâ€™re done with their feature, they can then merge their respective branch to the master branch, and deploy without having to wait for the second feature to be completed.

The Pros of using this workflow is, the git feature branch workflow allows you to collaborate on code and minimize code conflicts.
